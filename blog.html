        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
            keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
            lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

            The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but
            when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion
            ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented
            populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on
            the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the
            early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
            decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
            sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept
            in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in
            zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent
            in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
            historic and current range. </p>
